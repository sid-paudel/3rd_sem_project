            A genre is a word for a type of movie or a style of movie. Movies can be fictional (made up), or true, or a
            mix of the two. Although hundreds of movies are made every year, there are very few that do not follow a
            small number of set plots, or stories. Some movies mix together two or more genres.

            1.<u>Action</u> movies have a lot of exciting effects like car chases and gun fights, involving stuntmen.
            They
            usually involve 'goodies' and 'baddies', so war and crime are common subjects. Action movies usually need
            very little effort to watch, since the plot is normally simple. For example, in Die Hard, terrorists take
            control of a skyscraper and ask for a big ransom in exchange for not killing the hostage workers. One hero
            somehow manages to save everyone. Action movies do not usually make people cry, but if the action movie is
            also a drama, emotion will be involved.<br />
            2.<u>Adventure</u> Movies usually involve a hero who sets out on a quest to save the world or loved
            ones.<br />
            3.<u>Animated</u> movies use artificial images like talking pigs to tell a story. These movies used to be
            drawn by
            hand, one frame at a time, but are now made on computers.<br />
            4.<u>Buddy</u> movies involve 2 heroes, one must save the other, both must overcome obstacles. Buddy movies
            often
            involve comedy, but there is also some emotion, because of the close friendship between the 'buddies'.<br />
            5.<u>Comedies</u> are funny movies about people being silly or doing unusual things or being in silly or
            unusual
            situations that make the audience laugh.<br />
            6.<u>Documentaries</u> are movies that are (or claim to be) about real people and real events. They are
            nearly always
            serious and may involve strongly emotional subjects, for example cruelty.<br />
            7.<u>Dramas</u> are serious, and often about people falling in love or needing to make a big decision in
            their life.
            They tell stories about relationships between people. They usually follow a basic plot where one or two main
            characters (each actor plays a character) have to 'overcome' (get past) an obstacle (the thing stopping
            them) to get what they want.<br />

            8.<u>Horror</u> movies use fear to excite the audience. Music, lighting and sets (man-made places in movie
            studios
            where the movie is made) are all designed to add to the feeling.<br />
            9.<u>Romantic Comedies (Rom-Coms)</u> are usually love stories about 2 people from different worlds, who
            must
            overcome obstacles to be together. Rom-Coms are usually light-hearted, but may include some emotion.<br />
            10.<u>Science fiction</u> movies are set in the future or in outer space. Some use their future or alien
            settings to
            ask questions about the meaning of life or how we should think about life. Science fiction movies often use
            special effects to create images of alien worlds, outer space, alien creatures, and spaceships.<br />
            11.<u> Thrillers</u> are usually about a mystery, strange event, or crime that needs to be solved. The
            audience is kept
            guessing until the final minutes, when there are usually 'twists' in the plot (surprises).
            Suspense movies keep you on the edge of your seat. They usually have multiple twists that confuse the
            watcher.
